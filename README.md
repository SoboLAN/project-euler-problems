# Project Euler Problems

Contains my own implementations to Project Euler problems.

My personal requirements for the solutions are:

- all code must be written in Java
- no external library should be used as help, instead use only the functionality provided in Java Standard Edition
- execution time of a problem must be at most **4000ms** on a modern computer. Higher values means the problem was not solved correctly and it will not be merged in **master** branch until it is.
- refactoring and code re-organization can be done even after the merge, as long as it does not negatively impact performance.

# How to run

- Compile
- Main class is `sobolan.projecteuler.main.ProjectEuler`
- Simply run the main class with one command-line argument: the problem ID

E.g. `java sobolan.projecteuler.main.ProjectEuler 5`
